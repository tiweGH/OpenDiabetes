OpenDiabetesVault
=================

This project dealt with the redesign and further development of parts of the [OpenDiabetesVault](https://github.com/OpenDiabetes/OpenDiabetesVault) processing backend. More precisely, logical and structural data set filters were developed, as well as an exporter for the machine learning module.

To learn more about the usage of the data filters, slicers and the exporter, please take a look at our [Wiki](https://github.com/tiweGH/OpenDiabetes/wiki) pages.
