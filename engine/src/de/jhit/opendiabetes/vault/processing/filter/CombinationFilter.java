 * The CombinationFilter is a special kind of Filter. The CombinationFilter combines two Filter on different datasets. Another of itâ€™s special Features is, that the CombinationFilter has two lists of VaultEntry, which will be used later in the .filter method. The first list of VaultEntry is set during the Constructor, this set is the basicData. The Second list is only used during the filter. In the Constructor there will also be set two Filter (firstFilter and secondFilter).
