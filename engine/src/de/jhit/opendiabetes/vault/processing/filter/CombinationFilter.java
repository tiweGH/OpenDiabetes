 * is, that the CombinationFilter has two lists of VaultEntry, which will be
 * used later in the .filter method. The first list of VaultEntry is set during
 * the Constructor, this set is the basicData. The Second list is only used
 * during the filter. In the Constructor there will also be set two Filter
 * (firstFilter and secondFilter).
